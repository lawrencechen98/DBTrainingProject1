a) One of the challenges I faced was figuring out the relationship between the text that overlays the photo on the homepage and the navigation bar. The ordering of these items matters, and originally I had the text passing ontop of the navigation bar. Lawrence and I also found that the naming of classes and ids can become confusing if not standardized in some way between us. A lot can end up in the CSS file, and it's good to be able to figure out what corresponds to what.

b) I would like to learn how to make slideshows on a webpage for all of the great waffle photos we have. I would also like to learn how to better place photos in general.

a) The main challenge and mistake I faced was the foresight and planning of our website. I learned that the naming of different classes and blocks must be more specific, and that the styling in css needs to be more specific sometimes. Otherwise, unintended styling may affect other pages and areas that was not previously anticipated. Another challenge was to keep the navbar above the rest of the page. Natalie and I figured out how to layer and keep elements on top of each other. The main thing to be learned with this project is the process of working with others through github and keeping organized. 

b) I would like to learn how to make the website even more interactive and overall more appealing with better designs and graphics. More animations, transitions, or slides would tie a webpage together to look more professional.
